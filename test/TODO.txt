TODOS:

Handle pointers (WIP) (OUCH, should work but it is still to be tested very much, moreover, what happens when more than a variable is inserted?)

Insert parameter to tune between computation time reduction and precision.

Implement inserting cost proportional to number of execution

Refactor optimizer to create different variables for each cost, for better readability (Not so important...)

Enob propagation (WIP)

Actually use the model result and propagate to conversion (WIP only non aggregate values works)


TESTING:
Implement phi node (should be ok)
Implement call (there are some problem because of the VRA)
Implement the cost of function in terms o energy/time
Fix execution of function from root (does not use correct function now)


DONE:
Refactoring of inserting value info
Implement loading costs from file
Really solve the model, and then re-associate the selected variables
